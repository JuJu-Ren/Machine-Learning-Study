General supervised learning (house price prediction and online advertising problems), just use standard neural network models
Image recognition processing problems, you need to use **Convolution Neural Network**, namely **CNN**
When dealing with sequence signals like speech, a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) ** is used.
Complex problems such as autonomous driving require more complex hybrid neural network models
