* General supervised learning (house price prediction and online advertising problems), just use standard neural network models
Image recognition processing problems, you need to use **Convolution Neural Network**, namely **CNN**

* When dealing with sequence signals like speech, a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** is used.
Complex problems such as autonomous driving require more complex hybrid neural network models

**CNN** generally handles _image problems_, and **RNN** generally handles _speech signals_ Data 
types are generally divided into two types: **Structured Data** and **Unstructured Data**


* **Structured Data** usually refers to meaningful data, such as size, #bedrooms, price, etc. in house price prediction; such as User Age, Ad ID, etc. in online advertising

* **unstructured Data** usually refers to more abstract data, such as Audio, Image or Text
