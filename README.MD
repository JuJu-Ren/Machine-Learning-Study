# Machine Learning
## Background

### 1950
The "Turing Test" was developed by Alan Turing in 1950 to test whether a machine is actually clever. The device must be able to convince a person that it is not a computer but rather another person in order to pass the test.
### 1952
Arthur Samuel creates the first machine learning program in 1952. The computer program was a checkers player that got better with each game.
### 1956
A conference at Dartmouth University organized by Martin Minsky and John McCarthy with assistance from Claude Shannon and Nathan Rochester is regarded as the birthplace of artificial intelligence. Minsky persuaded the audience to choose "Artificial Intelligence" as the name for the emerging discipline.
### 1958
Frank Rosenblatt designs the Perceptron, the first artificial neural network.

### 1979 
Students at Stanford University invent the “Stanford Cart,” a mobile robot capable of moving autonomously around a room while avoiding obstacles.
### 1967
The algorithm “Nearest Neighbor” is written. This milestone is considered the birth of the field of pattern recognition in computers.
### 1981
Gerald Dejong introduces the concept of “Explanation Based Learning” (EBL), in which a computer analyzes the training data and creates general rules allowing the less important data to be discarded.
### 1985
Terry Sejnowski invents NetTalk, which learns to pronounce words in the same way a child would learn to do.
### 1990s
Work in Machine Learning moves from a knowledge-driven focus to a data-driven one. Scientists begin to create programs that analyze large quantities of data and extract conclusions from the results.
### 1997
The computer Deep Blue, by IBM, beats world chess champion Gary Kaspárov
### 2006 
Geoffrey Hinton coined the phrase “Deep Learning” to explain the new architectures of profound neural networks capable of learning much better models.
### 2011 
The Watson computer by IBM beats it human competitors at Jeopardy, a game show that consists of answering questions in natural language.
### 2012 
Jeff Dean, at Google, with the assistance of Andrew Ng (Stanford University), leads the project GoogleBrain, which developed a deep neural network using all of the capacity of the Google infrastructure to detect patterns in videos and images.
### 2012 
Geoffrey Hinton leads the winning team in the Computer Vision contest at Imagenet using a deep neural network (DNN). The team won by a large margin, giving rise to the current explosion of Machine Learning based on DNNs.

The research laboratory Google X uses GoogleBrain to autonomously analyze Youtube videos and detect those containing cats.
### 2014
Facebook develops DeepFace, an algorithm based on DNNs capable of recognizing people with the same precision as a human being.

Google buys DeepMind, a British deep learning startup that had recently demonstrated DNN capabilities with an algorithm capable of playing Atari games by simply viewing the pixels on the screen, the same way a person would. The algorithm, after hours of training, was capable of beating human experts in the games.
### 2015
Amazon launches its own Machine Learning platform.

Microsoft creates the “Distributed Machine Learning Toolkit”, which allows for the efficient distribution of machine learning problems to multiple computers.

Elon Musk and Sam Altman, among others, found the non-profit organization OoenAI, providing it with one billion dollars with the objective of ensuring that artificial intelligence has a positive impact on humanity.
### 2016 
Google DeepMind beats professional Go player Lee Sedol five games to one at what is considered to be one of the most complex board games.  Expert Go players confirmed that the algorithm was capable of making “creative” moves that they had never seen before.
