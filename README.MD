# Machine Learning
## Background

### 1950
The "Turing Test" was developed by Alan Turing in 1950 to test whether a machine is actually clever. The device must be able to convince a person that it is not a computer but rather another person in order to pass the test.
### 1952
Arthur Samuel creates the first machine learning program in 1952. The computer program was a checkers player that got better with each game.
### 1956
A conference at Dartmouth University organized by Martin Minsky and John McCarthy with assistance from Claude Shannon and Nathan Rochester is regarded as the birthplace of artificial intelligence. Minsky persuaded the audience to choose "Artificial Intelligence" as the name for the emerging discipline.
### 1958
Frank Rosenblatt designs the Perceptron, the first artificial neural network.

### 1979 
Students at Stanford University invent the “Stanford Cart,” a mobile robot capable of moving autonomously around a room while avoiding obstacles.
### 1967
The algorithm “Nearest Neighbor” is written. This milestone is considered the birth of the field of pattern recognition in computers.
### 1981
Gerald Dejong introduces the concept of “Explanation Based Learning” (EBL), in which a computer analyzes the training data and creates general rules allowing the less important data to be discarded.
### 1985
Terry Sejnowski invents NetTalk, which learns to pronounce words in the same way a child would learn to do.
